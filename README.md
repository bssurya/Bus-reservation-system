Introduction:
The Bus Reservation System is a software application designed to facilitate the booking and management of seats on a bus. This system allows passengers to book seats for their journeys, cancel bookings if necessary, and view seat availability and current bookings. The system is developed in C programming language.

Motivation Behind Choosing the Bus Reservation System Project:
Interest in Transportation Industry: Our fascination with the transportation industry, particularly the intricacies involved in managing passenger logistics, played a significant role in selecting this project.
Desire for Practical Application: Our value projects that have real-world applications and can make a tangible difference in people's lives. The Bus Reservation System project aligns perfectly with this mindset, as it addresses a common need for efficient seat booking and management in the bus transportation sector.

Functionality:

* Booking Seats: Passengers can book seats by providing their name, preferred seat class, food option, starting place, destination, and starting time. The system checks the availability of the selected seat and confirms the booking if the seat is available.


* Cancelling Bookings: Passengers can cancel their bookings by entering the seat number they want to cancel. The system checks if the seat is booked and cancels the booking if found, making the seat available for others.


* Displaying Seat Availability: The system displays the current status of all seats, indicating whether each seat is available or booked.
  

* Displaying Current Bookings: Passengers and administrators can view the list of current bookings, including details such as seat number, passenger name, seat class, food option, starting place, destination, and starting time.

Implementation:
Data Structures: The system utilizes structures to represent bookings, including seat number, passenger name, seat class, food option, starting place, destination, and starting time. Enums are used to define constants for seat classes and food options.
User Input: User input is obtained using standard input functions such as scanf and fgets. 
Seat Management: Seat availability is managed using a Boolean array, where each element represents the availability of a seat. When a seat is booked, the corresponding element in the array is set to true, indicating that the seat is no longer available.
Menu System: The system provides a menu-driven interface for users to navigate through different functionalities. Users can select options by entering the corresponding numbers.
Error Handling: The system includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid user inputs and prevent runtime errors.

What did I learn from this exercise?
Throughout the process of developing the Bus Reservation System project, I encountered a variety of challenges and opportunities for growth. Here are some key concepts that I explored and implemented, stepping outside of your comfort zone.
•	Learning C language from scratch.
•	Logics and implementation.
•	Teamwork.
•	Error handling.
Overall, the Bus Reservation System project provided us a valuable opportunity to explore and implement concepts outside of your comfort zone. By embracing these challenges and pushing ourselves to learn and grow, we have not only expanded your technical skills but also gained valuable insights into software development processes and best practices. This experience has equipped us with the confidence and expertise to tackle future projects with creativity, resilience, and a commitment to excellence.

Areas of improvement:
What things you could have improved on provided more time/experience?
User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface was a crucial aspect of the project which we couldn’t accomplish.
Documentation and Comments: While the code was well-structured and organized, there could have been more comprehensive documentation and comments to facilitate understanding and maintainability.
Security Measures: Security considerations, such as data encryption, authentication mechanisms, and access control, could have been further strengthened to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.
Code Optimization: With more experience, you could explore advanced programming techniques, data structures, and algorithms to optimize performance, reduce code redundancy, and enhance maintainability.

Future Scope: How do we foresee this project being useful in the future?
•	Expansion to Other Transportation Modes
•	Integration with Travel Planning Platforms
•	Real-time Updates and Notifications
•	Partnerships and Collaborations
